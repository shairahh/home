			<p> Abel was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario as the only child to Ethiopian immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu. However, when he was younger, his father had left him and his mother. He was then raised by his grandmother and mother in the district of Scarborough. As he was raised by his grandmother, he picked up his first language, Amharic, from her. The Weeknd attended both West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Collegiate Institute in high school. He had been kicked out from one and dropped out of the other in order to prioritize his party life and pursue music.</p>

The Weeknd had been influenced greatly by his cultural music and Prince. Others include Michael Jackson, David Bowie (a huge inspiration for his 2016 album, &ldquo;Starboy,&rdquo;) and R.
